# Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. 

## The Task

The task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with dates and times.

## Requirements

```
The app is designed for an employee with a busy schedule to be able to to add important events to a daily planner, so that they can manage their time effectively.
```


## User Experience

```
When a user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
When the user scrolls down, they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When the user clicks into a time block, they can enter an event and when they click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved.
When the user refreshes the page, the saved events remain available to view.
```

## User Experience
```
Parts of this assignment were very challenging. As usual, creating the interface wasn't too difficult, but getting local storage to work was harder. I learned a lot from that part.
