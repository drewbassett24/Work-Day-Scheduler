# Work-Day-SchedulerA simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. ## The TaskThe task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day in colour-coded time-slots, by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.## Linkhttps://drewbassett24.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/##Screenshots![Screenshot 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73472116/105529957-15e93700-5cdf-11eb-946a-3e0c49da15e8.jpg)![Screenshot 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73472116/105529965-18e42780-5cdf-11eb-891d-f46dfcec1f09.jpg)![Screenshot 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73472116/105529982-1c77ae80-5cdf-11eb-9af6-9482f09b09bb.jpg)```## Usage```When a user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.When the user scrolls down, they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future, with the present hour being red, future hours green and past hours  grey.When the user clicks into a time block, they can enter an event and when they click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved.When the user refreshes the page, the saved events remain available to view.```## Challenge and Learning```Parts of this assignment were very challenging. As usual, creating the interface wasn't too difficult, but getting local storage to work was hard. I actually needed a bit of helpo from classmates and my tutor for that and learned a lot from that part.```## Future Development.```I'd really like to dry up the last 18 or so lines of this code, where I added a lot of variables for different hours. Feedback commenbts suggested I should use a loop for this, which I intend to come back to when I get a chance.## Credits```Thanks to my tutors and Loosekonnection for their help!```
